# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# TrendingReposMobile

I coded this small android mobile app with the react-native framework. I opted for this choice on the one hand because of the speed of development offered by this framework wiht its concept of components that are put together to form the application to be sought; and on the other hand because of its credibility as this framework is used in the construction of large an professional app mobile like Facebook, Instagram, Skype, Pinterest and many more.
To run this app you must have either an # android emulator installed on your computer or an android phone with active debugging mode and connected by cable to your computer.
# The first thing to do is to detect the devices that you have been using, especially if it is a physical phone that you are going to use.For that type the following command in the terminal: "adb devices". after that opens two terminals in the folder where you have stored the project, in the first type "yarn or npm start" and press enter. Wait for it to launch the server and just after, in the second terminal type "react-native run-android". This command will compile the program and install it on the chosen device and you could finally browsethe apllication in its entirety.
